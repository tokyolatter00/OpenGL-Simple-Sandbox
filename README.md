## About

This is a 2D sandbox where the player can control a box. The box can move left, right and can also jump. The box is affected by gravity (causing the box to move down after it jumps) and friction (causing the box to stop moving left/right if the buttons are no longer pressed). This was made in C and OpenGL.
